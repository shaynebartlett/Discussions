Discussions
===========

Discussions is a Joomla! 2.5 forum extension.
It will most probably run on Joomla! 1.7 as well but from now on only Joomla! 2.5 is tested.
Joomla! 2.5 is the new Long Term Support Release(LTS) so if still run J1.7 or even J1.6 please update now and use Discussions 1.5.

Discussions 1.5 is the first release which will only be available for Joomla! 2.5 (1.7). Sorry, no more Joomla! 1.5 versions.
